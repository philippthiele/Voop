# Voop
Voop is a way to execute Boop scripts directly in VSCode. [Boop](https://github.com/IvanMathy/Boop) is a scriptable scratchpad that allows you to run any transformations on your text using the built-in or your self-written .js scripts.

## How to get Voop

You can get Voop from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.

## How to activate Voop in VSCode

Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` and enter `Voop`. Execute `Voop` to get a list of available scripts, execute `Voop: Reload Scripts` to update the list of available scripts after adding custom scripts to the custom scripts folder.

Use `Ctrl+Alt+V` as a quick alias for `Ctrl+Shift+P` + `Voop`.

## Custom Scripts

You can set the custom scripts folder in your VSCode User Settings (search for voop). For documentation on how to develop custom scripts refer to the original Boop documentation: https://github.com/IvanMathy/Boop/blob/main/Boop/Documentation/CustomScripts.md
